# Unit 1: Introduction to Simulation

## Simulation  
The process of designing a mathematical or logical model of a real system and then conducting computer-based experiments with the model to describe, explain, and predict the behavior of the real system.

## System  
A group of objects that are joined together in some regular interactions or interdependencies towards the accomplishment of a specific goal.

### Components of a System  
1. Entity  
2. Attribute  
3. Activity  
4. State  
5. Event  
   - **Endogenous**: arising from internal structure or functional cause  
   - **Exogenous**: having an external cause or origin  

## System Environment  
Changes occurring outside the system.

## Examples of systems and Components

System|Entity|Attribute|Activities|Events|State Variables|
------|------|---------|----------|------|---------------|
Banking|Customer|Account Balance|Making Deposit|Arrival and Departure|Number of customers waiting|

## Types of System
1. Discrete System
2. Continuous System

### Discrete System 
- State variables change only at a discrete set of points in time

   Example: Bank -> The number of csutomers changes only when a customer arrives or when the service provided to the customer is completed.

### Continuous System 
- State variables change continuously over time

   Example: Head of the water behind a dam


## Model 
- A representation of a system for the purpose of studying the system 
- A simplification of the system 
- Sufficiently detailed to permit valid conclusions to be drawn about the real system

### Types of Model
**1. Static or Dynamic Simulation Models**

- Static Simulation Model (called Monte Carlo Simulation) represents a system at a particular point in time

- Dynamic Simulation Models represent systems as they change over time

**2. Deterministic and Stoichastic Simulation Models**

- Deterministic Simulation Models contain no random variables and have a known set of inputs which will result in a unique set of outputs.

- Stoichastic Simulation Models have one or more random varibales as inputs. Random input lead to random output. 


## Model of a system
A model is defined as a representation of a system for the purpose os studying the system.  
The various types of models are:
- Mathematical Model ot Physical Model
- Static Model
- Dynamic Model
- Deterministic Models
- Stoichastic Model 
- Discrete Model

### 1. Mathemtical Model 
Use symbolic notation and the mathematical equations to represent a system  

### 2. Static Model  
Represents a system at a particular point of time and also known as Monte-Carlo Simulation

### 3. Dynamic Model 
Represents systems as they change over time. Example: Simulation of a bank  

### 4. Deterministic Model
Contains no random variables. They have a known set of inputs which will result in a unique set of outputs. 
Example: Arrival of patients at a Dentist at the scheduled appointment time.

### 5. Stoichastic Model 
Has one or more random variables as input.  
Random inputs lead to random output.  
Example: Simulation of a block involves random interarrival and service time.  

### 6. Discrete Event Simulation
Modelling of a system in which the state variables changes only at a discrete set of points in time.    
THe simulation models are analyzed by numerical rather than by analytical methods.

**_Example 1:_ RadioActive Decay**

Experiment shows that at each instant a radio-active substance decomposes, the rate of decomposition is propotional to the amount of substance present. Given a certain initial amount of a radioactive substance present at any time later.
```math
\text{Let, y = amount of substance present at any given time} \\
\text{y}_0 = \text{initial amount of substance} \\ \space \frac{\text{dy}}{\text{dt}} \space \alpha \space \text{y} \\
\text{Working Equation:} \space
\frac{\text{dy}}{\text{dt}} = -k\text{y}; \text{where} \space k \space \text{is propotionality decay constant}
```

**_Example 2:_ A freely falling body**

An object is falling under the influence of gravity as it falls downward. It is subjected to air resistance that creates an upward force propotional to the velocity of object. Obtain the differential equation that describes the velocity and the position of the object at any given time. Assume that the mass of body as $m$
and acceleration due to gravity $g$ â€” which is constant throughout the planet.

<div align="center">
   <img  src="images/example_2.png" height="200px">
   <p><b>Fig 02:</b> <i>Example_2 diagram</i></p>
</div>

Applying relevant physical law; **Newtons Law of acceleration**:_(2nd Law)_
```math
F_{net} = ma
```
Substituting forces:
```math
mg- kv = ma
```
Then, substiuting $a$ with $\frac{dv}{dt}$; we get:

```math
mg - kv = m \frac{dv}{dt}
```

Rearranging terms:
Dividing through by $m$:
```math
g- \frac{k}{m} v= \frac{dv}{dt}
```
On reagrranging: we get
```math
\frac{dv}{dt} + \frac{k}{m} v = g
```
This represents the first order diffrential equation.

Likewise, the second order differential equation would look like:
```math
\frac{dv^2}{dt^2} + \frac{k}{m} \frac{dy}{dt} = g
```

**_Example 3:_** RL Circuit

A series RL circuit connected in a voltage source $V$ develops a model of circuit describing the circuit at any time $ t > 0$

<div align="center">
   <img src="images/RL_ckt.png" width="300px">
   <p><b>Fig 03:</b><i> RL Circuit</i></p>
</div>

Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL):
```math
V- iR - L \frac{di}{dt} = 0 \\
or, L \frac{di}{dt} + iR = V \\
or \frac{di}{dt} + \frac{R}{L}i = \frac{V}{L}
```
describes current at any time t and is a **differential equation of first degree.**

## Analog Method of System Simulation
- Analog computers are those computers that are unified with devices like adder and integral so as to simulate the continuous mathematical model of the system which generates continuous output.
- Analog method of system simulation is for use of analog computers and other analog devices in the simulation of continuous systems.
- The analog computation is sometimes called differential analyzer. Electronics analog computers for simulation are based on the use of high gain dc amplifiers called operational amplifiers. (Op-amps)
- In such analog computers, voltages are equated to mathematical variables and the op-amps can add and integrate these voltages.
- The proper configuration can handle addition of several input voltages each representing the input variables.
- The general method to apply analog computers for the simulation of continuous system models involve following components:

    ***Example : Automatic Suspension Problem***

    The general method by which analog computers are applied can be demonstrated by the second order differential equation
    ``` math
    Mx'' + Dx' + Kx = KF(t)
    ```
    Solving the equation for the highest order derivative gives
    ``` math
    Mx'' = KF(t) - Dx' - Kx
    ```
    >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Diagram Needed


    Fig: Automobile Suspension System

    Suppose a variable representing the input `F(t)` is supplied, assume there exists variables representing `-x`, `x'`. These three variables can be scaled and added to produce `Mx''`. Integrating it with a scale factor `1/M` produces `x'`. Changing sign produces `-x'`, further integrating produces `-x`, a further sign inverter is included to produce `+x` as an output.

## Continuous System Models
- A continuous system is one in which the predominant activities of the system cause smooth changes in the attributes of the system entities. 
- When such a system is modelled mathematically the variables of the model representing the attributes are controlled by the continuous system.
- More generally in a continuous system the relationship describes the rate at which the variables representing the attributes change, so that the model circuit of differential equation.

## Differential and partial differential equation

> ### Differential Equation:
- A differential equation is an equation involving an unknown function and its derivative.
- The order of the differential equation is the order of the highest derivative of the unknown function involved in the equation.
```math
\frac{dy}{dt} = f(y,t) ...........................\text{(i)}
```
---

> ### Linear Differential Equation
- A linear differential equation of order `n` is a differential equation written in the following form.
    ```math
    a_n(x) d_n \frac{y}{dx^n} + a_{(n-1)}(x) + \frac{d_{(n-1)}(y)}{dx^(n-1)} + ... +a_1(x) \frac{dy}{dx}+ a_0(x)y = f(x)
    ```

    where `a_n(x), a_(n-1)(x), a_1(x), a_0(x)` are functions of `x` and `f(x)` is a function of `x`.
--- 

> ### Partial Differential Equation
- When more than one independent variable occur in a differential equation the equation is said to be partial differential equation.

    ***Example***:
    - An equation describing the flow of heat in a three-dimensional body. There are four independent variables, representing the three dimensions and time and one dependent variable representing temperatures.

    - The general heat conduction equation:
``` math
        \frac{d}{dx}(k.(\frac{dT}{dx})) + \frac{d}{dy}(k.(\frac{dT}{dy})) + \frac{d}{dz}(k.(\frac{dT}{dz})) + qv = \rho \space C_p \frac{dT}{dt}
```
    >- where k is the material conductivity.
    >- $qv$ is the rate at which energy is generated per unit volume of the medium.
    >- $\rho$ is the density
    >- $C_p$ is the specific heat capacity.

    This equation is also known as the Fourier-Biot equation and provides the basic tool for heat conduction analysis.

## Interactive and Feedback System in Simulation

> #### Interactive Systems
- Interactive Systems are the computer systems characterized by significant amount of interaction between humans and the computer. Macintosh and Windows computer operating systems are prime examples of graphical interactive systems.

- Editors, CAD-CAM(Computer Aided Design - Computer Aided Manufacture) system, and data entry systems are all computer systems involving a high degree of human - computer interaction. Games and simulations are interactive systems. Web browsers and integrated development environments (IDE) are also examples of very complex interactive systems.
