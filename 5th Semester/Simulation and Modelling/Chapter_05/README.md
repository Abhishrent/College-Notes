## Unit 5: Random Numbers

> *Qn. Define random numbers and describe why random numbers generated by computer are called pseudo random numbers*

**Random Numbers:**
They are samples drawn from a uniformly distributed random variable between some satisfied intervals, they have equal probabilities of occurence.

- A number chosen from some specified distribution randomly such  that selection of large set of those numbers reproduce the underlying distribution is called random number.

#### Types of Random Numbers
1. Truly Random Numbers
2. Pseudo Random Numbers

In computer random numbers are derived from a known starting point and is typically repeated ever and ever using some known algos to produce a sequence of numbers. The sequence of numbers are not completely random as the set of random numbers can be replicated because of use of some known methods. So, the random numbers generated by computers are called pseudo-random numbers.

Every new numbers is generated from the previous ones by an algorithm. This means that the new value is fully determined by the previous ones.

A pseudo-random numer generated is an algo for generating a sequence of  numbers whose properties approximates the properties of sequence of random numbers. The sequence is not truly random, but is deterministic because it is completely determined by the initial value called seed.

> Qn. Differentiate between true and pseudo-random numbers. What are the basic properties of random numbers?

#### True and Pseudo Random Numbers

| **Pseudo Random Numbers** | **True Random Numbers** |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Pseudo random numbers are the random numbers that are generated by using some known algos, so as to produce a sequence of numbers on $[0, 1]$ that can simulate the ideal properties of random numbers.| True random numbers are gained from physical processes like radioactive decay or also rolling a dice and introduce it to a computer |
| Number generation is fast | Comparatively slow |
| Sequence of numbers can be reproduced | Can't be reproduced |
| Sequence of numbers are repeated for sure| Will or will not repeat |

#### Properties of Random Numbers

1. Uniformity 
2. Independence
3. Max Density
4. Max Cycle

**Uniformity**:

The random numbers generated should be uniform that means a sequence of random numbers should be equally probable everywhere.

**Independence**:

Each random number should be independent sample drawn from a continuous uniform distribution between $0$ and $1$.

The probaility density function is given by:
```math
f(x) =
\begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } 0 \le x \le 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
```

**Max Density**:

The large samples of random numbers should be generated in a given image.

**Max Cycle**:

It states that the repetition of numbers should be allowed only after a large interval of time.

#### Some Common techniques to generate pseudo-random numbers:

1. Mid Square Method
2. Linear Congruential: $x_n = a x_{n-1} + C (\text{mod} \space m)$
3. Implicit Inversive Congruential: $x_n = \bar{ax_{n-1}} + C (\text{mod} \space p)$
4. Shift Register:
$$y_n = y_{n-s} + y_{n-r} (\text{mod} \space 2); r> s$$
5. Additive lagged-fibonacci:
$$Z_n = Z_{n-s} + Z_{n-r}(\text{mod} \space 2^k ); r>s$$
6. Combined: $w_n = y_n + Z_n \mod (p)$
7. Multiplicative lagged-fibonacci:
$$x_n = x_{n-s} * x_{n-r}(\text{mod} \space 2^k); r>s$$

#### Pseudo-Random Number Generation (PRNG):

1. **Mid Square Method:**

    It was given by **John Von Newmann and Metropolis in 1940**.

    ***Algorithm:***
    - Take any integer *(seed)* of say a two or four digit number.
    - Sqaure it and pick the middle two digits *(or four)* and discard the rest.
    - Now again square the selected middle two digits in the previous step.
    - Repeat

    ***Example 1:***
    | S.N. | Random Numbers | Square | Mid Digits |
    |------|----------------|--------|------------|
    |1 | 11 *(seed)* | 0 12 1 | 12 |
    |2 | 12 | 0 14 4 | 14 |
    |3 | 14 | 0 19 6 | 19 |
    |4 | 19 | 0 36 1 | 36 |
    |5 | 36 | 1 29 6 | 29 |
    |6 | 29 | 0 84 1 | 84 |
    | 7| 84 | 7 05 6 | 05 |
    | 8| 05 | 0 02 5 | 02 |
    | 9| 02 | 0 00 4 | 00 |
    |10| 00 | 0 00 0 | 00 |

    Mid Square Method *(Four Digits)*
    1. Start with a $4$- digit number $Z_0$ *(seed).*
    2. Square it to obtain $8$ - digit *(if necessary append zeros to the left)*.
    3. Take the middle $4$- digit to obtain the next $4$-digit number $Z_1$
    4. Then Square $Z_1$ and take the middle $4$- digit again and so on.
    5. We get unifor random number by placing the decimal points at the left of each $Z_i$.

2. **Linear Congruential Method:**
> By D.H. Lebmer

- To produce a sequence of integers $X_1$, $X_2 ... $ between $0$ and $(m -1)$ by following a recursive relationship.

> ***Recursive Relationship***:
> $$ X_{i+1} = (ax_i + c) \mod m ; \space i= 0, 1, 2 ...$$

- Assumption: $m > 0$ and $a < m$, $c< m$, $x_0 < m$.

- The selection of the values for $a,c,m$ and $x_0$ drastically affects the stastical properties and the cycle length

- The random integers $x_i$ are being generated in $[ 0, m-1]$
